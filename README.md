## User-story

  As a user I want to reach my workout goals and the best way to do that is to track it. I want to be able to make a daily log for multiple exercises in a workout per day. I need to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. With cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
